        <p>From the sun-drenched Pacific coast, leading east to the rugged tip of Purerua Peninsula, and wrapping west into calm Bay of Islands waters, Mataka Station is equal parts stunning coastline and majestic interior. Our varied shores offer a launch-point for adventure and a sanctuary for serenity. They embrace our vast interior, with its commanding mountains, forested valleys, dramatic cliffs, and expansive farmland. Walking and riding trails weave through this oasis of tranquility–visiting springs, streams, lakes, and waterfalls along the way. Elegant homes are dotted around the coast, for people who share a dream of living immersed in nature and surrounded by the sea.</p>

      <div class="body-text">
        <p>Mataka Station comprises just 30 lots of 20–57 hectares (50 - 140 acres). All lot owners belong to the Mataka Residents Association, an Incorporated Society governed by a constitution and a committee of elected officers. Membership grants shared access to all our roads, beaches, and trails, and the beach lodge, boatsheds, and mountaintop. Owners can build a home on a designated site within their lot. An independent panel ensures each home aligns with Mataka’s design guidelines. Owners may fence up to four hectares privately. They lease the remainder to the Association for conservation and farming. Each owner’s annual levy (about NZ$40,000) supports management of the infrastructure, leased land, and shared facilities.</p>

        <p>Mataka Beach is absolute perfection. Hundreds of meters of fine sand and dazzling sun front the Pacific Ocean, bookended by rock pools, cliffs, a waterfall, and the shade of enormous ancient pohutukawa trees. Further east, Nine Pin Track brings you to Nine Pin Beach and its notoriously abundant fishing. Our Bay of Islands shoreline offers the incredible seclusion of Howe Beach, and our boating-oriented beach and facilities at Whale Bay.</p>
